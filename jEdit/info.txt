The directory in which jEdit has been installed contains a folder named "modes".
The file scyndi.xml should be copied in there.
The file "catalog" should have this line:

<MODE NAME="scyndi"                FILE="scyndi.xml"
        FILE_NAME_GLOB="*.scyndi"/>

added between the <MODES> and </MODES> tag.



This is pretty delicate, and jEdit easily refuses to work this way, 
so it's recommended to make a backup of the original modes folder (the
"catalog" file in particular) before engaging into the actual operation.
